# World Demography Analysis using  R

# Data Objective
 Showing trends of birth rate among continents.
 
 Identifying trends that explains the rate of internet users among population.
 
 Identifying continent with high income rate.
 
 Analysing population and density in respect to birth rate.

# Data Overview
The Data used was gotten from World data review, which includes.
Demography data, Countries by continent, Countries table. 

# Data Cleaning 
 These data set was merged together using vlook-up in excel and cleaned before importing to R for analysis. The cleaned dataset(World demography) consists of 194 Observations and 7 variables. The Population variable was converted to log 10 for easy visualization.
 The variables are:
	Country,Birthrate,Continent,Population(2024),Density,Internet user,Income group.

On average, Europe and Asia has the highest income group.

Only Asia and Africa has population with low income.

For both upper income and lower middle income Asia has the highest average.

Among the continent Oceania is  the least in average for all income groups.

Asia has the highest population on average among the continents. However, justaposing the bar chart in slide 6 with this box plot, Africa has the highest Population.
On average, Oceania is the least populated.

The bar chat below shows that  South America is the least populated.

Africa is the most populated continent with a low population density in comparison with its population, also it is more  populated with low income group as seen in the box plot above. Asia has the highest population density.

N.B - Population density is the measurement of population per unit and land area.

Africa has the highest birth rate, with North America having the least birth rate in respect to population

This explains that the population of Africa as a continent  is due to birth rate rather than immigration.

Europe has the least birth rate in respect to population, and it the third populated continent and this is as a result of immigration <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/w/ddn-20240711-1"> reference

Africa has the highest population, highest birth rate and the least internet users. these means most African countries are not exposed to technology, this can also be linked to the income rate, the higher the income the more affordable internet can be.

Europe is the least populated by birth rate and has the highest income group on average with the highest internet user.

Continents with high income group as seen in slide 4 box plot have high internet user.

Oceania and South America despite being the least populated continent have high internet users.

# Recommendations

For Africa countries, health organization should loudly encourage family planning.

High Income group in Africa can be increased if majority of the population  are exposed to the internet and the benefit that cones with it.

Internet access can be made affordable.
