# World Demography Analysis using  R

# Data Objective
 Showing trends of birth rate among continents.
 
 Identifying trends that explains the rate of internet users among population.
 
 Identifying continent with high income rate.
 
 Analysing population and density in respect to birth rate.

# Data Overview
The Data used was gotten from World data review, which includes.
Demography data, Countries by continent, Countries table. 

# Data Cleaning 
 These data set was merged together using vlook-up in excel and cleaned before importing to R for analysis. The cleaned dataset(World demography) consists of 194 Observations and 7 variables. The Population variable was converted to log 10 for easy visualization.
 The variables are:
	Country,Birthrate,Continent,Population(2024),Density,Internet user,Income group.

Africa is the most populated continent with a low population density in comparison with its population, also it is more  populated with low income group as seen in the box plot above. Asia has the highest population density.

N.B - Population density is the measurement of population per unit and land area.
